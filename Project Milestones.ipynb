The motors were connected to an Arduino Uno for motor control and then powered by four AA batteries. We also added a Raspberry PI for to control the entire system. A camera module was attached to the Raspberry PI 4 for image detection. We are now done with the hardware phase of the vehicle and will tackle the software setup in the next phase.\n",
