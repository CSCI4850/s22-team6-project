    "We set up the car using a pre-built plastic frame to which four independent motors were attached. The motors were connected to an Arduino Uno for motor control and then powered by four AA batteries. We also added a Raspberry PI for to control the entire system. A camera module was attached to the Raspberry PI 4 for image detection. We are now done with the hardware phase of the vehicle and will tackle the software setup in the next phase.\n",

One problem we faced was lack of equipment to solder wires on to the Arduino.
